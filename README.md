## Film Query Application

### Week 6 Skill Distillery Weekend Homework

#### Overview
Film Query is a simple command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It is menu based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. As I needed database access methods,  I declared them first in the DatabaseAccessor interface, then implemented them in DatabaseAccessorObject. Methods return objects like Film, Actor, and List<Actor>.

All JDBC code  is encapsulated in methods of the com.skilldistillery.filmquery.database.DatabaseAccessorObject class.
All user input and display output are methods in com.skilldistillery.filmquery.app.FilmQueryApp.



#### Technologies Used
Java, JDBC, SQL, Eclipse;

#### Lessons Learned
- Focused on encapsulation
- Improved ability to retrieve data from a database
- Learned JDBC code
